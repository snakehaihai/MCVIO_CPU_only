# Update 13 Jan 2024
This repo is forked from https://github.com/shockwaveHe/MCVIO

The original MCVIO is a better organized 360 repo when compared with other works like Xuhao`s vins_fisheye

The key purpose of this repo is to 
* run the MCVIO without VPI
* run without changing system eigen, opencv and ceres. 
* deleted some unused directories and libraries.

To use it. you need to modify a few files

1. Cmakelist:
download and configure each eigen, opencv and ceres accordingly and only build in local directory. do not use sudo make install to avoid conflict with other parts of the OS. Then change the set path to each of the build directory to use the required version of each function.

2. MCVIO_frontend.yaml:
this code does contain absolute directories for some yaml. do change it accordingly

3. MCVIO_estimator.yaml:
this code does contain absolute directories for some yaml. do change it accordingly (to be modified next time with just one bash file to install and modify. for now keep it as it is)

Then go to Section 3 and run per normally

Good luck

# MCVIO: Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Odometry

## Toward Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry with Multiple Nonoverlapping Monocular Cameras

We present a Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)
algorithm with multiple non-overlapping monocular cameras
aiming at improving the robustness of the VIO algorithm.
An initialization scheme and tightly-coupled bundle adjustment
for multiple non-overlapping monocular cameras are proposed.
With more stable features captured by multiple cameras, VIO
can maintain stable state estimation, especially when one of
the cameras tracked unstable or limited features. We also
address the high CPU usage rate brought by multiple cameras
by proposing a GPU-accelerated frontend. Finally, we use
our pedestrian carried system to evaluate the robustness of
the VIO algorithm in several challenging environments. The
results show that the multi-camera setup yields significantly
higher estimation robustness than a monocular system while
not increasing the CPU usage rate.

## 1. Prerequisites
1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**

Ubuntu  20.04.
ROS Noetic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
additional ROS pacakge
```
    sudo apt-get install ros-YOUR_DISTRO-cv-bridge ros-YOUR_DISTRO-tf ros-YOUR_DISTRO-message-filters ros-YOUR_DISTRO-image-transport
```
To run the program on older Ubuntu version, the headers for OpenCV in the source code should be adjusted to the correct versions. 

1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html), remember to **make install**.
(Our testing environment: Ubuntu 20.04, ROS Noetic, OpenCV 4.2, Eigen 3.3.3, Ceres 2.0.0, C++17) 

1.3. **Vision Programming Interface (VPI)**
(Optional)
This repo removed most of the VPI part. so technically can be use without VPI easily.

Follow [VPI installation](https://docs.nvidia.com/vpi/installation.html).
(Our testing environment: VPI 1.0, it should work for VPI 2.0. If your are using version above 1.0, the configuration for VPI in CMakeLists should be adjusted. There are some bugs when using the VPI Pyramidal LK Optical Flow. Our codes already consider these bugs. If VPI resolve the bugs, remember to fix the code in vpi_feature_tracker.)

## 2. Build MCVIO on ROS
Clone the repository and catkin_make:
```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/shockwaveHe/MCVIO.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## 3. Run MCVIO
```
    roslaunch mcvio MCVIO_estimator.launch 
    cd src/MCVIO/launch/
    rviz -d MCVIO_VIEW.launch
    rosbag play <Your path to dataset>/<Your bag file>.bag 
```

## 4. Datasets
4.1 Public datasets

Our MCVIO was tested on the [EuRoC MAV Dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets).

4.2 Our own collected datasets

Due to storage issue, we currently can only provide one bag file [indoor_1.bag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgq2AQ8pjkjaF8iNTKtnjAbXENSp33v3/view?usp=share_link). More datasets will be released later.

## 6. Notes for Usage and Future Development

6.1 We use the ***frame_id*** in ROS messages as identifier for different sensors. Please provide the correct ***frame_id*** to ***sensor_list*** in the configuration. If there are different sensors having the same id or missing the id, errors may occur.

6.2 Our work highlight the scalability in terms of adding more sensors. We define the ***MCVIOsensor*** and ***TrackerBase*** class for future developers to easily add new type of sensors and behaviors through inherentance. We already use this feature to develop a multi-spectral inertial odometry. The latest work will be released soon!
